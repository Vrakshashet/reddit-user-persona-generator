Post Body: I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.
